# 🎲 Pig Game

An interactive two-player dice game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project simulates turn-based logic, dynamic UI updates, and game state management — a great exercise in DOM manipulation and event-driven programming.

> Practice game loops, event handling, and user interaction — with a bit of fun!

## 📖 Game Rules

- 🎯 **Goal**: Be the **first player to reach 100 points**.
- 👥 **Two players take turns** rolling the dice.
- 🎲 On your turn:

  - Roll the dice as many times as you like.
  - Each roll adds to your **current score**.
  - Rolling a **1** ends your turn and resets your current score.
  - Click **"Hold"** to add your current score to your total and pass the turn.

- 🏆 First to **100 points** wins the game!

- ✅ Game state management and turn switching
- ✅ Conditional logic and loops
- ✅ Event-driven UI updates
- ✅ Clean modular function structure (`init`, `switchPlayer`)
